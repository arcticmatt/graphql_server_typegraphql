# graphql_server_typegraphql

An example GraphQL server implemented using [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/).

## Setup

This repository is based on https://github.com/arcticmatt/graphql_server_base.

## Yarn scripts

### Running the code

Run the server with `yarn start`. Since we're using `ts-node-dev`, the server will be restarted when any relevant changes are made. Then go to http://localhost:4000/graphql to run queries.

### Testing the code

TODO should test with jest.

### Typechecking the code

Run `yarn tsc`.

### Linting the code

Run `yarn eslint`.
